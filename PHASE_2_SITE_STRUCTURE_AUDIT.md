Action: DELETE IMMEDIATELY
  1. Remove folder: /app/blog/best-tumble-dryers-uk/

```
Status: ❌ EMPTY (no page.tsx)
Issue: Folder exists but no content
Impact:

  - Dead link if referenced
  - Incomplete information architecture
  - Will return 404

Action: EITHER DELETE OR COMPLETE
  Option A: Delete the folder entirely
    - Remove: /app/blog/heat-pump-tumble-dryer/
    - Update sitemap
    - Monitor logs for 404s

Impact: Duplicate content penalty risk
Resolution: Verify content
  1. Check if both exist and have unique content
  2. If one is thin, 301 redirect to the other
  3. If both are comprehensive, differentiate:

     - "heat-pump-installation-cost-uk" = Installation costs
  4. Add internal links between them for differentiation

Recommendation: VERIFY and differentiate or consolidate
