- Important for time-sensitive topics

### 3. **Update Tracking**
- If you update an article, change the date

## 🔄 When to Update Dates

### Update `<lastmod>` When:

1. **Publishing new articles**
   - Always set `<lastmod>` to publication date
   - Example: New article published today → `<lastmod>2026-01-15</lastmod>`

2. **Making significant updates to existing articles**
   - Change date to update date
   - Example: Updated article on Jan 20 → `<lastmod>2026-01-20</lastmod>`

3. **Minor corrections only**
   - You can keep the original publication date
   - Minor spelling/grammar fixes don't require date change

### When NOT to Update:

- ❌ Don't change dates for every tiny edit
- ❌ Don't set future dates (use today or earlier)
- ❌ Don't make up dates (use actual dates)
